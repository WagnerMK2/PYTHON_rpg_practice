item RARITY status type = common, uncommon, rare, very rare, legendary, pearlesant
'the master type is the spawn/status type. after that an item can dull and degrade over time. this brings in the quality durability level.
Borderlands uses a classification system for gear that follows a color-coding system for RPGs (which was pioneered by Blizzard's Diablo). A common (white) gun would be average, an uncommon (green) would be slightly above average, a rare (blue) would be a premium gun, a very rare (purple) would be a very strong gun, and legendary (orange) guns are second only to pearlescent. The rarity of each gun is indicated by color as stated on the page of each gun.
'

UNIQUE items = unique items are pregenerated and do not go through the random generation proccess except for its various stats, they will be based on level, and have a narrow window for random stats that it spawns with.
each unique weapon will have flavor text as well as a paragraph lon description, and short history. it will enbew effects and possibly nerfs along with buffs. in the case of a cursed item it will be forever duable and sharp but will over time eat your hp.



FLAVOR TEXT

Flavor text is red text found on unique, legendary, and pearlescent weapons' item cards, just above any stat modifiers. Usually cryptic or humorous, these lines usually give a hint of what a weapon's special ability does, and are often a reference to a video game, movie, or any number of non-game things.
